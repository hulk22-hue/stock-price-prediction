# Stock Price Prediction

This project aims to predict stock prices using historical stock data and LSTM networks.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` script to fetch data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The performance of the LSTM model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results are plotted to show actual vs. predicted stock prices.
